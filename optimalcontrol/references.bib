  abstract     = "Optimal control theory is a branch of control theory that
                  deals with finding a control for a dynamical system over a
                  period of time such that an objective function is
                  optimized.[1] It has numerous applications in science,
                  engineering and operations research. For example, the
                  dynamical system might be a spacecraft with controls
                  corresponding to rocket thrusters, and the objective might be
                  to reach the Moon with minimum fuel expenditure.[2] Or the
                  dynamical system could be a nation's economy, with the
                  objective to minimize unemployment; the controls in this case
                  could be fiscal and monetary policy.[3] A dynamical system
                  may also be introduced to embed operations research problems
                  within the framework of optimal control theory.[4][5]",
